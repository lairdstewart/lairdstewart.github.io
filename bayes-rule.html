<h3 id="notes-on-bayes-rule">Notes on Bayes’ rule</h3>
<p><img src="venn-diagram.svg" width="30%"></p>
<p>Consider a rectangular dartboard with two circles <span
class="math inline">A</span> and <span class="math inline">B</span>
drawn on it. A monkey is throwing darts at the board, and they fall
randomly within it. The probability that the dart falls within the
circle labeled <span class="math inline">A</span> is its area divided by
the area of the rectangle, <span class="math inline">20/100=0.2</span>.
Now imagine you’re facing the other way and the money throws the dart.
The bartender tells you it landed in <span class="math inline">B</span>.
What is the probability it also landed in <span
class="math inline">A</span> (i.e., in the purple intersection)? It’s
hopefully intuitive this is the area of the purple section divided by
the red section, <span class="math inline">4/12=0.33</span>.</p>
<p>Bayes’ rule formalizes this: <span class="math display">
P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}\tag{1}
</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">P(A)</span> is the probability of
event <span class="math inline">A</span> occurring and <span
class="math inline">P(A|B)</span> is the probability of <span
class="math inline">A</span> occurring given that <span
class="math inline">B</span> occurred. Plugging in the probabilities
from the dartboard example, we get the result we expect: <span
class="math display">
P(A|B)=\frac{(4/20)\times (20/100)}{(12/100)}=4/12=0.33\tag{2}
</span></p>
<p>One way to derive Bayes rule is by starting with the definition of
joint probability: <span class="math display">
P(A\cap B)=P(A|B)P(B)=P(B|A)P(A)\tag{3}
</span></p>
<p>If you aren’t convinced of this fact, consider the dartboard again.
You can think of <span class="math inline">P(A|B)</span> as what % of
the red circle is covered by the purple section. Or, in other words, the
ratio of the area of the purple section to that of the red section. If
we then multiply that by the area of the red section, we’re left with
the area of the purple section. You can use the same logic to convince
yourself of the third term in (3). Finding Bayes’ rule is as simple as
dividing (3) by <span class="math inline">P(B)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a step back, and think more about (1). <span
class="math inline">P(A|B)</span> is a probability and therefore bounded
between 0 and 1. How does this fraction ensure this is the case? It’s
clear that it won’t be negative as the three components are all
positive. But if <span class="math inline">P(B)\to 0</span>, why
wouldn’t this fraction grow to infinity? The reason is that <span
class="math inline">P(B|A)P(A)=P(A\cap B)</span> which is strictly less
than or equal to <span class="math inline">P(B)</span>.</p>
<p>In (1), <span class="math inline">P(A)</span> is called the prior and
<span class="math inline">P(A|B)</span> the posterior since <span
class="math inline">P(A)</span> was our belief about the probability of
event <span class="math inline">A</span> occurring before observing the
event <span class="math inline">B</span>, and <span
class="math inline">P(A|B)</span> is our belief about its probability
after (prior to) observing <span class="math inline">B</span>.</p>
