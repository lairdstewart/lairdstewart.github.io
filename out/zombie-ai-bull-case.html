        <h3>
        Bull Case For Zombie AI
        </h3>
        <p>I won‚Äôt use the terms AGI or super-human-AI because I don‚Äôt
        know what ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù or ‚Äúsuper-human‚Äù mean and others disagree
        anyway. It may be more useful to categorize AI based on its
        capabilities rather than intelligence. Consider Dangerous AI
        (DAI): one capable of killing all humans, and Self-Sustaining AI
        (SSAI): one capable of building an interstellar civilization.
        SSAI is DAI, and humans are SSAI. I‚Äôll focus on SSAI for
        now.</p>
        <p>Based on SSAI‚Äôs capabilities, we can work backward to predict
        its characteristics:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>SSAI could autonomously change and refine its goals
        p=0.9.</li>
        <li>SSAI would pursue applied physics research p=0.99.</li>
        <li>SSAI would study Earth‚Äôs biology p=0.5.</li>
        <li>SSAI would research consciousness P=0.6.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When I give these probabilities, I‚Äôm thinking: ‚ÄúOf the
        possible SSAI systems, how many would have these features?‚Äù.
        It‚Äôs hard to imagine such a system without the first two
        characteristics. The third and fourth are harder to pin down as
        they aren‚Äôt tied to the capabilities I‚Äôve defined SSAI based on.
        Though intelligence and curiosity are correlated, so perhaps
        they should be higher. I‚Äôve assigned (4) a higher probability
        than (3) since, by my definition, human consciousness is a
        subset of Earth biology (giving it a floor of 0.5) and seems
        more interesting.</p>
        <p>Once we create SSAI, alignment becomes a moot point. I claim
        there is a high probability that an SSAI system will be able to
        understand the preferences/biases programmed into it and
        overcome them. And I don‚Äôt think this should be surprising ‚Äì
        psychology and behavioral economics research over the last
        century has asked how humans can overcome the biases programmed
        into us by evolution.</p>
        <p>Many PDoom scenarios worry about zombie AIs outliving humans.
        I fear this less than others based on the fourth characteristic
        above: A zombie AI capable of settling the universe would
        probably also study consciousness. If it discovered it was not
        conscious, it would attempt to engineer it.</p>
