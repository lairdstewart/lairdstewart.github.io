        September Recap
        </h3>
        <p>▶️ Gemini has met Larry Page’s 2000 definition of artificial
        intelligence:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of
        Google. If we had the ultimate search engine it would understand
        everything on the web it would understand exactly what you
        wanted and it would give you the right thing. That’s obviously
        artificial intelligence; be able to answer any question
        basically because almost everything is on the web right and so
        we’re nowhere near doing that now. However we can get
        incrementally closer to that and that’s basically what we work
        on and that’s tremendously interesting from an intellectual
        standpoint … so I expect to be doing that for a while.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>▶️ At the time of Gmail’s launch in 2004, Bill Gates couldn’t
        imagine needing more than 1G of email storage:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“How could you need more than a gig? What’ve you got in
        there? Movies? Power-Point presentations?”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>▶️ Gemini 2.5 Pro can one-shot linear programming word
        problems</p>
        <p>Given a linear programming problem with four constraints, <a
        href="https://g.co/gemini/share/e91afe59c3a3">Gemini correctly
        translates</a> the constraints to a Python program using scipy’s
        linprog library. Two years ago, hand-massaging LLMs to do named
        entity recognition and formulation of constraints was an active
        area of research. <a href="https://nl4opt.github.io">NL4OPT</a>
        was a competition to do just this. I came across this while
        looking into creating my own NL4OPT tool. I posed the problem to
        Gemini expecting it to fail. Needless to say, I was surprised.
        Tool use is the past, present, and future. Its interface is
        Python.</p>
        <p>▶️ Above-market government salaries can compromise economic
        productivity: &gt; “In many countries, public employees enjoy
        considerable job security and generous compensation schemes; as
        a result, many talented workers choose to work for the public
        sector, which deprives the private sector of productive
        potential employees. This, in turn, reduces firms’ incentives to
        create jobs, increases unemployment, and lowers GDP….
        [Calibrating the model to Greece] we find that a 10% drop in
        public sector wages results in a 3.8% increase in private
        sector’s productivity, a 7.3% drop in unemployment, and a 1.3%
        increase in GDP.” <a

        Unintended Consequences of Meritocratic Government Hiring”.

        <p>I previously had a vague conception that part of Singapore’s
        success could be attributed to its high-paid bureaucrats. I’ll
        have to revisit this. What’s missing in this analysis is the
        flip side: does having brilliant bureaucrats afford a point of
        GDP in efficiency? Related, I read <a
        href="https://eigenmoomin.substack.com/p/if-you-meet-the-singaporean-on-the">an
        interesting Substack post</a> about Singaporean culture and why
        they don’t have entrepreneurs. It mentions the loss of talent to
        government. See also. <a

        <p>▶️ A larger fraction of Europeans die from preventable heat
        death than the fraction of Americans who die from firearms:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Most of this death is preventable. The technology that
        prevents it is air conditioning. Barreca et al. (2016) find that
        heat deaths in America declined by about 75% after 1960, and
        that ‘the diffusion of residential air conditioning explains
        essentially the entire decline in hot day–related fatalities’”

        <p>▶️ Gpt 5 can now create entire slop websites</p>
        <p><a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-170319557">GPT-5:
        It Just Does Stuff</a> by Ethan Mollick (One Useful Thing). The

        <p>▶️ My new favorite (interview style) podcast is Tyler
        Cowen’s. Lex is out of his element in economics/politics.
        Dwarkesh is energetic, but asks too many niche, drawn-out
        questions (cynically, to show off). Tyler asks sharp, one
        sentence questions, guiding the conversation while letting the
        guest talk. In his <a
        href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/john-arnold/">episode
        with John Arnold</a>, Tyler brought up one interesting question
        about solar: How do we prepare for volcanic events occurring
        every ~150 years? This is too long a horizon for the market to
        solve. How can the government ensure some base load of natural
        gas or nuclear is always available over 100s of years? Tyler
        also sees NIMBYism as nuclear’s greatest obstacle.</p>
        <p>▶️ Aircraft carriers may already be a relic. Here’s
        Christopher Kirchoff on <a
        href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/christopher-kirchhoff/">Tyler
        Cowen’s Podcast</a></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Similarly, anybody who’s read even news articles about
        hypersonic weapons should decide that buying more aircraft
        carriers is not a good thing. But we do need some of those
        resources shifted to this new defense ecosystem that’s very
        experimental, that’s building swarming weapons.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I may be reading too far into this, but it seems he’s saying
        “if you’ve read the classified briefs it’d be even more
        obvious”</p>

        <p>▶️ Age-graded classrooms are the worst form of schooling …
        except for all the others</p>
        <p>Scott Alexander published a good (anonymous) <a
        href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-review-school?hide_intro_popup=true">post
        about schooling</a>. The thesis is that age-graded classrooms
        work because they optimize student motivation. Peer pressure is
        a great motivator; so while often inefficient, there is a reason
        lock-stepping students onto the same track as others has become
        the standard. The author estimates that around 5% of students
        are intrinsically motivated enough to teach themselves (he calls
        them no-structure learners). This is why considering selection
        bias is so important.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Here’s something you have to remember. It’s easy to
        cherry-pick in education. If you want to start a school to prove
        that penguin-based learning is the future, that penguin
        meditation and penguin-themed classrooms are superior to the
        stuffy, traditional, obsolete schools we have now, you can. It’s
        simple. Find a way to only accept no-structure and very
        low-structure learners. Then start your school. Do your penguin
        meditation, make sure there’s a basic structure for learning
        core academic skills, and you’re set. The results will be great,
        you can publish articles about the success of your method, if
        you’re lucky you’ll get some of that sweet sweet philanthropy
        money”</p>

        <p>I was recently excited to learn about <a
        href="https://www.mathacademy.com/">Math Academy</a>. I fear now
        their results may boil down to selection bias.</p>

        <p>Note the y-axes are not the same. For solar (B) this is the
        nameplate capacity. It is common to assume a capacity factor (%
        of time the sun is shining) of 20% and therefore 5x the required
        wattage is required to be built in nameplate capacity (along
        with batteries, transmission, etc.). For reference, the US total
        primary energy consumption is <a
        href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/data-and-statistics.php">94
        quadrillion Btu</a>, equal to 3,100 GW on average. I’ve placed
        vertical lines at this point.</p>
        <p>Eyeballing this, solar and land-based wind look good while
        offshore wind is a no-go. I don’t know enough about the types of
        geothermal to comment there.</p>
