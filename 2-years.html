        <h3>
        Reflections on Two Years Of Software Engineering
        </h3>
        <p>This advice is general, but probably biased by my background
        with legacy Java applications.</p>
        <p>First, work through MIT‚Äôs <a
        href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu">‚ÄúThe Missing Semester of
        Your CS Education‚Äù</a></p>
        <p>Useful concepts</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Chesterton‚Äôs Fence: A hiker comes across a small wooden
        fence on a beautiful hillside which anyone could step over. He
        removes it to restore the place‚Äôs beauty; it wouldn‚Äôt stop
        trespassers anyway. Once he has left, over the next months the
        cows from the neighboring farm eat all its grass and trample it
        into a muddy slope. When building software, if you encounter
        something that seems poorly designed, figure out why it was
        designed that way before refactoring or removing it.</li>
        <li>Pareto Principle (power law): Most real-world relationships
        are non-linear. E.g., 80% of revenue comes from 20% of
        customers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One example of the Pareto Principle is methods which speed up
        typing:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Touch typing</li>
        <li>Vim key bindings</li>
        <li>Dvoark layout</li>
        <li>Ergonomic keyboard</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Touch typing will get you 80% of the way to a ‚Äúpro‚Äù typist
        while Vim keybindings will get you another 15%. Changing
        keyboard layouts could help a little beyond that. Although touch
        typing provides 5x more value than Vim keybindings, it‚Äôs about
        the same difficulty to learn. My suggestion: if you can‚Äôt
        already touch type, learn now. If you can, learn vim
        keybindings. Don‚Äôt worry about keyboard layouts, taking ‚ÄúThe
        Missing Semester‚Äù, reading books about software development, and
        networking are all better uses of your time.</p>
        <p>Minimize configuration. ‚ÄúEvery line of configuration is a
        liability‚Äù - ThePrimagen. It‚Äôs tempting to spend a lot of time
        configuring your IDE, terminal emulator, and shell. First,
        remember Chesterton‚Äôs Fence ‚Äì the creators of dev tools designed
        their tool‚Äôs features and configuration intentionally (often for
        their own use!). Another drawback is that you will inevitably
        need to switch computers, help colleagues, or ssh into a server.
        These are all more difficult if you can‚Äôt use default
        configurations. My suggestion: when starting with a new tool,
        use its vanilla configuration for the first month (or more).
        Learn its core features before configuring settings or
        installing plugins.</p>
        <p>Learn the command line versions of tools</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>They are more feature-rich</li>
        <li>They can be scripted</li>
        <li>Amortize costs of learning the CLI (terminal emulator,
        shell) and supporting tools (e.g., tmux, man) across multiple
        applications.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Try the simple/open source tool first. More often than not it
        has all the functionality you‚Äôll need and is easier to learn. If
        you discover a functionality it doesn‚Äôt have, you‚Äôll be more
        prepared to choose a paid offering. For example, VisualVM has
        suited all my Java profiling needs so far.</p>
        <p>I read a few books on software engineering. It was a good use
        of my time. Ranked (power law applies here):</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>A Philosophy of Software Design ‚Äì John Ousterhout</li>
        <li>Code that Fits in Your Head ‚Äì Mark Seemann</li>
        <li>Working Effectively with Legacy Code ‚Äì Michael Feathers</li>
        <li>Design Patterns ‚Äì Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides</li>
        <li>Refactoring for Software Design Smells ‚Äì Suryanarayana,
        Samarthyam, Sharma</li>
        <li>Clean Code ‚Äì Robert Martin</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And finally, a few tips I try to follow (but <a
        href="beware-pithy-rules.md">beware pithy rules</a> like
        these)</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Make simplicity the number one priority</li>
        <li>Use pure methods and immutable data whenever possible</li>
        <li>Favor composition over inheritance</li>
        <li>Favor strong typing</li>
        </ul>

            (function () {
                const toggle = document.getElementById('theme-toggle');
                const prefersDark = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches;
                const stored = localStorage.getItem('theme');
                if (stored === 'dark' || (!stored && prefersDark)) {
                    document.body.classList.add('dark');
                    toggle.textContent = 'üåô';
                    toggle.style.color = '#fff';
                }
                toggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
                    if (document.body.classList.contains('dark')) {
                        document.body.classList.remove('dark');
