<h3>Online Master's Programs are Worthless</h3>

When I say "Online Master's" I mean fully remote programs for professionals from accredited institutions. For example, JHU [Engineering for Professionals](https://ep.jhu.edu/), where I've taken courses. These programs provide value via

1. Instruction (materials and guidance provided by the professor)
2. Signaling (proxy for intelligence/conscientiousness – for career advancement)

The introduction of reasoning models represents a drastic decrease in the value of both factors. First, equivalent instruction is possible via the combination of publicly available syllabi and recorded lectures in concert with LLM tutors.

|                   | Online MS | Internet | Reasoning Model |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Syllabus/Homework | X         | X        |                 |
| Lectures          | X         | X        |                 |
| Tutoring/Feedback | X         |          | X               |

Second, the elephant in the room, reasoning models can get As in most classes. I’ve only tested these models on physics, math, and CS courses, but I suspect this is the case for all STEM subjects. Whether or not you want to call this cheating, if a student wishes to do so, they can get an A with almost no effort and without learning anything. If they haven't already, employers and PhD admissions committees will soon realize that online Master's degrees are only worth the student's word.

I predict online Master's programs will lose 90% of their value in the next year as LLM tutors improve and employers wake up. Assuming these programs won't suddenly fall 90% in price, I expect enrollment to fall. 

### What next?

I won't be taking any more classes at JHU. I'm toying with the idea of finding a group of coworkers or friends who want to find a textbook or recorded online course to study together. If I were in charge of my company's HR department, I would stop compensating employees for online coursework. I would also stop counting online Master's programs awarded after 2025 as "years of experience" when calculating salary scales. Finally, if I were a director making hiring decisions, I would weigh online Master's coursework equally to a prospective hire claiming to have self-taught a course via a recorded lecture series and LLM tutor.

Given the following observations:

- What previously costed $2,500 (assuming instruction is 1/2 the value of these courses) can now be offered for the price of an LLM subscription.
- Demand for post-graduate education will increase as students drop out of (or never begin) these programs

There's an opportunity here for a startup (or open source project). I'm imagining a service that organizes publicly released lectures and syllabi and matches students with others in their city to form study groups. What remains is solving the signaling and student motivation problems[1]. Perhaps signaling could be solved by peer reviews or in-person final exams at testing centers. Motivation is trickier.
