### About
I'm a software engineer at [Metron Inc.](https://metsci.com) where I develop tracking and sensor-fusion algorithms for maritime systems. I studied applied math at Emory and computer engineering at Georgia Tech. I take part-time coursework at Johns Hopkinsâ€”most recently plasma physics. I plan to pursue a PhD focused on some combination of simulation, numerical analysis, and machine learning. Most of what [I read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/184711854-laird-stewart) centers on energy, technology, history, and progress. I'd like to write more.
