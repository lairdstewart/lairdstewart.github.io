        <h3>
        Beware of Pithy Rules About Software
        </h3>
        <p>The root cause of a lot of bad code is the overuse of common
        rules (e.g., DRY, YAGNI, ‚Äúkeep methods under X lines‚Äù). These
        are well-intentioned and distill years of programming expertise.
        However, even in a world where they‚Äôre right 90% of the time,
        the 10% of times they‚Äôre wrong translates to technical debt
        which compounds quickly. This isn‚Äôt to say their creators are at
        fault; These rules are often introduced with disclaimers about
        overuse. The problem is that these catchy sayings don‚Äôt have
        room for disclaimers. After learning a new rule, new developers
        may only remember the acronym and not any of its nuances. Senior
        developers aren‚Äôt innocent either; During code review, it‚Äôs
        easier to cite a rule than explain the underlying issue with the
        code. Teachers don‚Äôt want to overwhelm students, so they may
        give a blanket statement like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use static methods‚Äù. There
        is a direct relationship between the length of a piece of advice
        and its value. Longer answers can provide context, edge cases,
        and describe more sophisticated concepts. It shouldn‚Äôt be a
        surprise that short, general statements can lead us astray.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>‚ÄúMethods should be shorter than X lines‚Äù</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The professor of my software design course at Georgia Tech
        suggested methods should be under five lines, and <em>Clean
        Code</em> claims <em>‚ÄúThe first rule of functions is that they
        should be small. The second rule of functions is that they
        should be smaller than that.‚Äù</em> In my mind, this rule is just
        a heuristic to remind us that methods should generally only have
        a single ‚Äúconcept‚Äù. I argue that because the former is easier to
        remember it gets used (and abused) more frequently. See <a
        href="https://qntm.org/clean">It‚Äôs probably time to stop
        recommending Clean Code</a> for an example of how this can go
        too far.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt repeat yourself‚Äù</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In my first internship, I inherited a thousand-line R script
        with code literally copy and pasted half a dozen times with
        different hard-coded parameters. DRY is a powerful concept when
        you first learn it, and I‚Äôve met a number of data scientists who
        could have learned it sooner. However, entry level software
        engineers understand copy and pasting code is a red flag.
        However, it can cause more harm than good in the form of
        premature optimization and over-abstraction.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>‚ÄúComments are a failure to express yourself through code‚Äù</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Early on at my first job, I came across this saying in
        <em>Clean Code</em>. It seemed reasonable, and my team already
        used comments sparingly, so I accepted it at face value. Over my
        first year, I wrote nearly no comments. I went so far as to
        leave PR comments to explain confusing bits because I
        internalized that putting it in the code was a failure. I‚Äôve
        since grown a much more favorable outlook on comments. The
        ultimate irony is that, upon returning to the chapter on
        comments in <em>Clean Code</em>, I agree almost entirely with
        it. But because I only remembered this one saying, my outlook on
        the topic was quite warped.</p>
