    <h3 id="beware-of-pithy-rules-about-software">Beware of Pithy Rules
    About Software</h3>
    <p>The root cause of a lot of bad code is the overuse of common
    rules (e.g., DRY, YAGNI, “keep methods under X lines”). These are
    well-intentioned and distill years of programming expertise.
    However, even in a world where they’re right 90% of the time, the
    10% of times they’re wrong translates to technical debt which
    compounds quickly. This isn’t to say their creators are at fault;
    These rules are often introduced with disclaimers about overuse. The
    problem is that these catchy sayings don’t have room for
    disclaimers. After learning a new rule, new developers may only
    remember the acronym and not any of its nuances. Senior developers
    aren’t innocent either; During code review, it’s easier to cite a
    rule than explain the underlying issue with the code. Teachers don’t
    want to overwhelm students, so they may give a blanket statement
    like “don’t use static methods”. There is a direct relationship
    between the length of a piece of advice and its value. Longer
    answers can provide context, edge cases, and describe more
    sophisticated concepts. It shouldn’t be a surprise that short,
    general statements can lead us astray.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>“Methods should be shorter than X lines”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The professor of my software design course at Georgia Tech
    suggested methods should be under five lines, and <em>Clean
    Code</em> claims <em>“The first rule of functions is that they
    should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be
    smaller than that.”</em> In my mind, this rule is just a heuristic
    to remind us that methods should generally only have a single
    “concept”. I argue that because the former is easier to remember it
    gets used (and abused) more frequently. See <a
    href="https://qntm.org/clean">It’s probably time to stop
    recommending Clean Code</a> for an example of how this can go too
    far.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>“Don’t repeat yourself”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In my first internship, I inherited a thousand-line R script with
    code literally copy and pasted half a dozen times with different
    hard-coded parameters. DRY is a powerful concept when you first
    learn it, and I’ve met a number of data scientists who could have
    learned it sooner. However, entry level software engineers
    understand copy and pasting code is a red flag. However, it can
    cause more harm than good in the form of premature optimization and
    over-abstraction.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>“Comments are a failure to express yourself through code”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Early on at my first job, I came across this saying in <em>Clean
    Code</em>. It seemed reasonable, and my team already used comments
    sparingly, so I accepted it at face value. Over my first year, I
    wrote nearly no comments. I went so far as to leave PR comments to
    explain confusing bits because I internalized that putting it in the
    code was a failure. I’ve since grown a much more favorable outlook
    on comments. The ultimate irony is that, upon returning to the
    chapter on comments in <em>Clean Code</em>, I agree almost entirely
    with it. But because I only remembered this one saying, my outlook
    on the topic was quite warped.</p>
