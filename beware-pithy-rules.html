<h3 id="beware-of-pithy-rules-about-software">Beware of Pithy Rules
About Software</h3>
<p>The root cause of a lot of bad code is the overuse of common rules
(e.g., DRY, YAGNI, “keep methods under X lines”). These are
well-intentioned and distill years of programming expertise. However,
even in a world where they’re right 90% of the time, the 10% of times
they’re wrong translates to technical debt which compounds quickly. This
isn’t to say their creators are at fault; These rules are often
introduced with disclaimers about overuse. The problem is that these
catchy sayings don’t have room for disclaimers. After learning a new
rule, new developers may only remember the acronym and not any of its
nuances. Senior developers aren’t innocent either; During code review,
it’s easier to cite a rule than explain the underlying issue with the
code. Teachers don’t want to overwhelm students, so they may give a
blanket statement like “don’t use static methods”. There is a direct
relationship between the length of a piece of advice and its value.
Longer answers can provide context, edge cases, and describe more
sophisticated concepts. It shouldn’t be a surprise that short, general
statements can lead us astray.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Methods should be shorter than X lines”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The professor of my software design course at Georgia Tech suggested
methods should be under five lines, and <em>Clean Code</em> claims
<em>“The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The
second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that.”</em>
In my mind, this rule is just a heuristic to remind us that methods
should generally only have a single “concept”. I argue that because the
former is easier to remember it gets used (and abused) more frequently.
See <a href="https://qntm.org/clean">It’s probably time to stop
recommending Clean Code</a> for an example of how this can go too
far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t repeat yourself”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my first internship, I inherited a thousand-line R script with
code literally copy and pasted half a dozen times with different
hard-coded parameters. DRY is a powerful concept when you first learn
it, and I’ve met a number of data scientists who could have learned it
sooner. However, entry level software engineers understand copy and
pasting code is a red flag. However, it can cause more harm than good in
the form of premature optimization and over-abstraction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Comments are a failure to express yourself through code”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Early on at my first job, I came across this saying in <em>Clean
Code</em>. It seemed reasonable, and my team already used comments
sparingly, so I accepted it at face value. Over my first year, I wrote
nearly no comments. I went so far as to leave PR comments to explain
confusing bits because I internalized that putting it in the code was a
failure. I’ve since grown a much more favorable outlook on comments. The
ultimate irony is that, upon returning to the chapter on comments in
<em>Clean Code</em>, I agree almost entirely with it. But because I only
remembered this one saying, my outlook on the topic was quite
warped.</p>
