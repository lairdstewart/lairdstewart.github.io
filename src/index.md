<h3 id="about">About</h3>

I'm a software engineer at [Metron Inc.](https://metsci.com) developing tracking and sensor-fusion algorithms for maritime systems. I studied applied math at Emory and computer engineering at Georgia Tech. I take part-time coursework at Johns Hopkinsâ€”currently Theory of Machine Learning. Most of what [I read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/184711854-laird-stewart) centers on energy, technology, history, and progress. I'd like to write more.
