              A year ago, Claude struggled to generate bash commands without
              escaping issues. It worked for seconds or minutes at a time. We
              saw early signs that it may become broadly useful for coding one
              day.

            <blockquote>
            The common view is that a manager proposes some technical project,
            the team gets together to figure out how long it would take to
            build, and then the manager makes staffing and planning decisions
            with that information. In fact, it’s the reverse: a manager comes
            to the team with an estimate already in hand, and then the team
            must figure out what kind of technical project might be possible
            within that estimate.

            Central Stockholm renters face a 20-year wait due to rent control
        </p>
        <div style="padding-left: 1em">
            <blockquote>
            If you’re looking for a standard rental contract in Stockholm, you’ll have to
            be prepared to wait. Apartments are allocated through a waitlist, and in 2025,
            new tenants in the city center had waited an average of 21 years. Rents are
            regulated, and can be far below half of market rents at the most attractive
            addresses.

        A 2014 interview with Walter Isaacson at Khan Academy

        </p>
        <div style="padding-left: 1em">
            I'm a fan of Isaacson's books, but had never heard him speak. He's
            quite charismatic. He thinks one driver of creativity which we've
            lost is the connection between the arts/humanities and
            science/engineering (the classic Steve Jobs mantra). Similarly, he
            thinks that cities which lack creative types and a culture of
            humanities will fail to produce innovation in the long run. He was
            more bullish on SF than Palo Alto/Mountain View. Granted, this was
            10 years ago. SF is back on the rise, but confounded by AI. Suggest
            starting at 24:00

            Yeah, and I'm trying to say if you look at Ben Franklin, the most important
            scientist of his period. Even though you probably don't... You know, we think
            of him as a doddering dude playing his kite in the rain. Single fluid theory of
            electricity that comes from his electricity experiments is up there in that
            century, you know, with Newton, even. I mean, he's the best experimental
            scientist of his time. Jefferson would have thought you were a Philistine if
            you didn't study botany and everything else. Nowadays, people like a Ben
            Franklin don't do electricity experiments.
