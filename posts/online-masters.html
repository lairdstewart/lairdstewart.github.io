        <h3>
        Online Master‚Äôs Programs are Worthless
        </h3>
        <p>When I say ‚ÄúOnline Master‚Äôs‚Äù I mean fully remote programs for
        professionals from accredited institutions. For example, JHU <a
        href="https://ep.jhu.edu/">Engineering for Professionals</a>,
        where I‚Äôve taken courses. These programs provide value via</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Instruction (materials and guidance provided by the
        professor)</li>
        <li>Signaling (proxy for intelligence/conscientiousness ‚Äì for
        career advancement)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The introduction of reasoning models represents a drastic
        decrease in the value of both factors. First, equivalent
        instruction is possible via the combination of publicly
        available syllabi and recorded lectures in concert with LLM
        tutors.</p>
        <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Online MS</th>
        <th>Internet</th>
        <th>Reasoning Model</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td>Syllabus/Homework</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Lectures</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Tutoring/Feedback</td>
        <td>X</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>X</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Second, the elephant in the room, reasoning models can get As
        in most classes. I‚Äôve only tested these models on physics, math,
        and CS courses, but I suspect this is the case for all STEM
        subjects. Whether or not you want to call this cheating, if a
        student wishes to do so, they can get an A with almost no effort
        and without learning anything. If they haven‚Äôt already,
        employers and PhD admissions committees will soon realize that
        online Master‚Äôs degrees are only worth the student‚Äôs word.</p>
        <p>I predict online Master‚Äôs programs will lose 90% of their
        value in the next year as LLM tutors improve and employers wake
        up. Assuming these programs won‚Äôt suddenly fall 90% in price, I
        expect enrollment to fall.</p>
        <h3 id="what-next">What next?</h3>
        <p>I won‚Äôt be taking any more classes at JHU. I‚Äôm toying with
        the idea of finding a group of coworkers or friends who want to
        find a textbook or recorded online course to study together. If
        I were in charge of my company‚Äôs HR department, I would stop
        compensating employees for online coursework. I would also stop
        counting online Master‚Äôs programs awarded after 2025 as ‚Äúyears
        of experience‚Äù when calculating salary scales. Finally, if I
        were a director making hiring decisions, I would weigh online
        Master‚Äôs coursework equally to a prospective hire claiming to
        have self-taught a course via a recorded lecture series and LLM
        tutor.</p>
        <p>Given the following observations:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>What previously costed $2,500 (assuming instruction is 1/2
        the value of these courses) can now be offered for the price of
        an LLM subscription.</li>
        <li>Demand for post-graduate education will increase as students
        drop out of (or never begin) these programs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There‚Äôs an opportunity here for a startup (or open source
        project). I‚Äôm imagining a service that organizes publicly
        released lectures and syllabi and matches students with others
        in their city to form study groups. What remains is recovering
        the lost signaling value. Perhaps peer reviews or in-person
        final exams at testing centers.</p>
